Some notes to look into:

You can enhance creativity by practising, implementing, observing, getting inspired etc.
It can go beyond arts and can be in any field.<br>
'C' implies first time in the history of human existence . To create something new for the world <br>
'c' implies something new to you.<br>
With more knowledge, we have more resources to reflect and refer back to. a wider knowledge base implies a better scope for creativity with more experiences merging together.<br>
Learning is building scaffolds. Creativity is connecting scaffolds <br>
Learning is taking from the world, Creativity is giving to the world <br>

The Stapler's Enigma

How does it work?<br>
How would have someone come up with a compact model of a stapler?<br>
Is there a way to make it safer?<br>
What is the metal plate for and why is it reversible?<br>
What metals are used for making the pins?<br>
Is there a coating to prevent rusting?<br>
Why do two staples get jammed together at times inspite of the sixe specifications?<br>
What is the spring for?<br>
Why such a design for the stapler?<br>
Could it have been made extremely light or of a non-metallic substance?<br>
Why does this stapler not have the thing at the back to remove a pin?<br>
Are there other ductile materials apart from the metals used?<br>
Is there a way to dismantle it?<br>
What could have inspired this design?<br>
What are the scratches from?<br>
Why is it so robust?<br>
Can a softer material be used?<br>
Stapler as an airfreshner?<br>
Why can we not select number of staples used at a time?<br>

  <h2>What makes a problem good?</h2>

  Make it clear and succint. <br>
  When the supply is more than the demand. <br>
  When it gives an opportunity for growth. <br>
  When it targets a particular issue in our lives. <br>
  When it an help bring about change. <br>
  A long term problem rather than a short term one <br>
  A global concern targetted issue. <br>
  Something that hasn't been thought about before. <br>
  A problem that is the heart of several problems. <br>
  Something that is fulfilling <br>
  Solving a problem brings satisfaction <br>
  One that doesn't need indepth knowledge<br>


  <h2>How do you come up with a good one?</h2>

  Something that involves you.  <br>
  Watching that happens around you. Being inquisitive. <br>
  Think about what affects people the most. <br>
  Think about the reasons <br>
  Something that'll immediately reflect in your life <br>
  juxtaposing two problems and coming up with one <br>
  Look for the needs and issues around you. <br>
  Looking at the final goal <br>
  Targetting the market <br>
  Looking at nature and how things work around you <br>
  Comparisons <br>
  Talking and realising <br>
  Introspection and Reflection <br>
  Empathy<br>
  Understanding others and seeing things from a different perspective<br>
  Define scope and combine relevant and tangible problems <br>
</p>

<h2> Awesome Acronyms</h2>
<ul>
<li>VCR - Virtually Controlled Raft</li>
<li>ASAP - Anti Strees activated peace</li>
<li>TTYL - Tender toothless youthful longing</li>
<li>LOL - Loving our lost</li>
</ul>


<h2> Fortifying the Four I's </h2>

<ol>
<li>Identify: This concept revolves around finding the problem. To know if the problem is good, it should be engaging and relatable. Problems are mislabeled opportnities and empathising can help find these treasure troves. We need to keep observing and exploring and need to get out of the shell to identify!</li>
<li>Ideate: Brainstorming and reflecting are two key features I believe. Juxtaposing ideas and putting curiosity to action can help build bold ideas. Think without any constraints. Build up the stockpile of knowledge. Diverge and then converge. Keep pivoting. </li>
<li>Initiate: Taking the first step - be it research or prototyping - is important. Going out and testing the feasibility of the ideas are must. Team building, networking and assembling. Analysing the risk. From idea to a project. Setting milestones and having deadlines. </li>
<li>Implement: Perservering. Put the research and ideation to work. Testing it, experimenting, getting feedback, developing the product. Just taking risk and heading out to make something. To shape the ideas to reality. If solution adds value to the user. was it worth it? Did we really solve the problem?  </li>
</ol>

Lotus Blossom - 

Way to share individual ideas.
Tke existing ideas or generate something new.
Use music and other creative media according to the idea.
Use three senses.

How about marketing a bad trip?

30-Hour travel trip with flight delays and luggage losses
Only flying and you wont get what you see
We are going to give you food poisoning
Quarantine
There would be zombies on the planes
Dirty bathrooms
You end up in the ocean in the middle of nowhere
They are going to drug you and throw you off the plane
You'll end up in a long lost desolate island
Language barriers
Can't understand the flight attendants
You lose your pasport
Pickpocketing
Identity Theft
People after you
Cannibals on the Island

</p>
<p>
I would like to get inspired by nature when working on finding a solution for an engineering problem. I want to work with a different set of people and thus want to amalgamate knowledge from different fields. If I venture into the entrepreneurial world, brainstorming ideas with inspiration from this course can help.

I can apply it to the field of Virtual Reality and IoT as well to create something of a social impact.
