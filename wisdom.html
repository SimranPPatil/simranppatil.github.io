Reflecting back on how to choose your team is something that can be befuddling. There isn'i a particular measure to quantify what qualities a person can bring to the table.

Pi-people can be interesting. The notion of having a stockpile of knowledge that branches out into areas of interest and the depth of knowledge.

Empathy can matter so much in the world. It is when we reflect on the world from the point of view of others that we get deeper understanding of the problems and opportunities.

There is a strong relationship between creativity and risk taking. Experience helps. Hiring experts and planning can fascilitate. Working on problems from different perspectives is a good way to tackle the issue. Without venturing out we can't grow. So take risks and fear not.

I am going to write my favourite poem here. It fits in so well i feel:

When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
<br>
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,<br>
When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>
When care is pressing you down a bit-<br>
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.<br>
Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>

As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>
And many a fellow turns about<br>
When he might have won had he stuck it out.<br>
Don't give up though the pace seems slow -<br>
You may succeed with another blow.<br>
Often the goal is nearer than<br>

It seems to a faint and faltering man;<br>
Often the struggler has given up<br>
Whe he might have captured the victor's cup;<br>
And he learned too late when the night came down,<br>
How close he was to the golden crown.<br>
Success is failure turned inside out -<br>

The silver tint in the clouds of doubt,<br>
And you never can tell how close you are,<br>
It might be near when it seems afar;<br>
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -<br>
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.<br>


Nature is full of crazy innovative recipes that work with only a few elements of the periodic table. There is so much to explore.

Failures are important. It is critical to accept ones shortcomings and working towards improvisation is vital.

We spend a great amount of time comparing with others. If we focus on ourselves, we can do so much more. It can amazing. 

Getting to know on a personal basis is important. Personal goals can differ and that can mean that the team isn't cohesive.

How to break out of the mundane thought process and provocate ideas?

Shifting of design and character of the group can be a sad thing to witness. Shortlisting goals at the very start can help. Having a team contract and designing protocols can help.

Diverging before we converge in a solution can help. Remixing is awesome!

Realise what you can bring to the table. No ideas are bad.

Ideas can inspire other ideas. 

Habit I would like to build in the course of the semester:
Time Management and trying not to worry :)

The Pitches -

Public speaking is an art altogether and practising this form is a very crucial part of my well being. The experience was pretty good. I think I should have rehearsed it beforehand in order to have presented it all better but I missed on it. I liked how some of them had an element of humor and a boost of confidence. The variety of problems and the diverse scope was amazing.
